# Knuth's Concrete Mathematics Practice Problems

## Description
These are ancient practice problems I worked in 2021 or earlier while studying Knuth's Concrete Mathematics. I scrap booked them in Jupyter Notebook and returned in 2023 to clean this repo. This book is extremely challening and I never made it very far.
